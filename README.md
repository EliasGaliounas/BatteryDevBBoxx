# BBoxx Lithium-Ion Battery Field Data Challenge
Data from off-grid Lithium-Ion Batteries in combination with solar panels operating in sub-Saharan Africa was analyzed as part of the [2022 BatteryDEV Hackathon](https://github.com/BatteryDEV/Field-Data-Challenge-Template-Public).

This repository provides the notebooks that were used to generate the results that are detailed in the [final report](https://github.com/EliasGaliounas/BatteryDevBBoxx/blob/main/Report.pdf).

## Installation
To get started clone this repository and install the required packages.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/EliasGaliounas/BatteryDevBBoxx
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
* The data can be retrieved from the [challenge repo](https://github.com/BatteryDEV/Field-Data-Challenge-Template-Public#data-files).
* The [notebooks](https://github.com/EliasGaliounas/BatteryDevBBoxx/tree/main/notebooks) folder contains all the Jupyter Notebooks used during the event to process the data.
* To launch the dashboard run the notebook [1.Dataload.ipynb](https://github.com/EliasGaliounas/BatteryDevBBoxx/blob/etienne_exploration/dashboard/1.Dataload.ipynb) notebook, followed by [2.Dashboard_full_t22.ipynb](https://github.com/EliasGaliounas/BatteryDevBBoxx/blob/etienne_exploration/dashboard/2.Dashboard_full_t22.ipynb). You will then be able to launch the dashboard localy from the generated link.

## Details
All the code used for the competition is located in the [notebooks](https://github.com/EliasGaliounas/BatteryDevBBoxx/tree/main/notebooks) folder
- The *cleaned_data* folder contains transfomred data used for some visualizations.
- The *plot_functions* folder contains all the graphical fucntions called by the dashboard during execution.
- The *Clustering-by-power-time-of-day-maps.ipynb* notebook was used to do some exploration, notably with PCA algorithms, which are detailed in the report.
- The *Dashboard_full_t22.ipynb* notebook contains the code for the interactive web page dashboard.
- The *Multivariate Time Series Clustering.ipynb* notebook contains code used to calculate the clusters using the temporal series.
- The *SoC-binned-PCA-and-clustering.ipynb* notebook hosts the code that was used to do anallysis on aggregation of the raw data, also detailed in the report.
- The *dataload.ipynb* notebook is the original template notebook that was give. Some, slight modifications were made to prepare the data
